# [Project/Component Name]: Atomic Task Design Document

**Author:** [Your Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Task ID/Reference:** [e.g., JIRA-123, GH-42]

## 1. Overview

**Goal:**
Provide a concise summary of the atomic task—what is being built or changed and why.

**Context:**
Briefly describe the larger system or feature this task belongs to. If it’s a refactor or bug fix, mention the relevant component or function.

**Key Outcomes / Success Criteria:**
List 2–3 clear, measurable outcomes that will define success.
- Example: *The function returns results 30% faster.*
- Example: *Reduced error rate from 5% to 1%.*

## 2. Background & Motivation

**Current State:**
- What is the existing behavior, structure, or code that we’re modifying?
- Are there known problems, technical debts, or inefficiencies?

**Why This Task:**
Explain why this task is needed now. Is it addressing a bug, improving performance, fulfilling a new requirement, or reducing future complexity?

## 3. Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Precisely define what needs to be implemented.
- Specify inputs, outputs, and edge cases.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance constraints (e.g., must handle X operations per second).
- Security, accessibility, or compliance considerations.
- Maintainability and scalability goals.

## 4. Proposed Solution

**High-Level Approach:**
- Outline the chosen design/implementation strategy.
- Summarize alternative approaches considered and why they were not chosen.

**Architecture / Diagrams (Optional):**
- Include a simple diagram showing data flow, component interaction, or class relationships if it aids clarity.

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**
- Mention any chosen data structures, sorting methods, or patterns.
- Highlight if any new libraries or frameworks will be introduced.

**Error Handling & Edge Cases:**
- Describe how errors will be surfaced, logged, and/or recovered from.
- Explicitly note how rare or extreme inputs will be handled.

## 5. Detailed Steps / Implementation Plan

Break down the atomic task into small, incremental steps.
- **Step 1:** [e.g., Refactor function `X` to extract reusable logic]
- **Step 2:** [e.g., Implement new endpoint `Y` to expose the processed data]
- **Step 3:** [e.g., Write unit tests for scenarios A, B, and C]

These steps should be actionable and easy to follow.

## 6. Testing Strategy

**Test Cases:**
- List test cases covering normal, boundary, and error conditions.
- Include examples of input and expected output.

**Automation & Tools:**
- Note any testing frameworks, mock tools, or CI/CD pipelines that will be used.

**Performance Testing (if applicable):**
- Describe how you will measure performance improvements or confirm resource usage constraints.

## 7. Dependencies & Integration

- Identify any external services, APIs, libraries, or datasets this task depends on.
- Mention if the task requires coordination with other teams or components.

## 8. Deployment & Rollout Plan

- How will the changes be integrated into the main codebase?
- Any migration steps needed for data or configuration?
- How will you verify success in production? (e.g., canary release, feature toggle, monitoring)

## 9. Maintenance & Support

- Who owns the code long-term?
- What metrics or logs will be tracked post-release?
- Document any known limitations or “future improvements” ideas.

## 10. Open Questions & Assumptions

- List any unresolved questions, risks, or assumptions.
- Note if answers are pending from stakeholders or if further investigation is required.

This template is intentionally lightweight yet structured, focusing on clarity, traceability, and actionable detail. It aims to help developers quickly understand the “what, why, and how” of a given atomic task.
