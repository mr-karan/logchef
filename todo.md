- [ ] Vector ingest logs
- [ ] UI for source management
- [ ] Logs panel
- [ ] echo v5 + upgrade all important deps
- [ ] golang migrate

functional log viewer with:

1. Proper typing for log data structures
2. A reusable LogTable component with:
   - Timestamp formatting
   - Severity level badges with colors
   - Truncated message display
   - Monospace font for log messages
3. Loading and error states
4. Basic fetch functionality

Next steps would be to add:
1. Infinite scrolling
2. Advanced filtering
3. Full text search
4. Time range selection
5. Live tail functionality

Would you like me to continue with any of these features?
