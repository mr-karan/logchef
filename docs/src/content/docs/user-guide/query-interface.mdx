# Query Interface

Logchef provides a powerful query interface that combines the flexibility of SQL with an intuitive visual builder. This guide will help you master log querying in Logchef.

## Query Builder

The query builder consists of three main components:

1. Visual Query Builder
2. SQL Editor
3. Results View

### Visual Query Builder

The visual builder lets you construct queries without writing SQL:

- **Time Range**: Select predefined ranges or specify custom intervals
- **Fields**: Choose which log fields to display
- **Filters**: Add conditions to filter your logs
- **Group By**: Aggregate logs by specific fields
- **Sort**: Order results by timestamp or other fields
- **Limit**: Control the number of results returned

### SQL Editor

For advanced users, the SQL editor provides full access to Clickhouse's SQL capabilities:

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE) as time_bucket,
  level,
  count() as count
FROM logs
WHERE
  timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
  AND level IN ('error', 'warning')
GROUP BY
  time_bucket,
  level
ORDER BY
  time_bucket DESC
```

### Results View

Results can be viewed in multiple formats:

- **Table View**: Traditional tabular format
- **JSON View**: Raw JSON format
- **Time Series**: Visualize time-based data
- **Logs View**: Optimized for log reading with syntax highlighting

## Common Query Patterns

### Error Analysis

Find error patterns in your logs:

```sql
SELECT
  error_type,
  count() as error_count,
  arrayJoin(groupArray(message)) as sample_messages
FROM logs
WHERE
  level = 'error'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY
  error_type
ORDER BY
  error_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Response Time Analysis

Analyze API response times:

```sql
SELECT
  path,
  count() as requests,
  avg(response_time) as avg_response_time,
  quantile(0.95)(response_time) as p95_response_time
FROM logs
WHERE
  timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
  AND type = 'access_log'
GROUP BY
  path
HAVING
  requests > 100
ORDER BY
  avg_response_time DESC
```

### Log Volume Analysis

Monitor log volume trends:

```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfHour(timestamp) as hour,
  service,
  count() as log_count
FROM logs
WHERE
  timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY
  hour,
  service
ORDER BY
  hour DESC,
  log_count DESC
```

## Advanced Features

### Saved Queries

Save frequently used queries:

1. Write your query
2. Click "Save Query"
3. Give it a name and description
4. Optionally share with team members

### Query Variables

Use variables in your queries:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM logs
WHERE
  timestamp >= {start_time}
  AND timestamp <= {end_time}
  AND service = {service_name:String}
```

### Query Scheduling

Schedule queries to run periodically:

1. Save your query
2. Click "Schedule"
3. Set interval (hourly, daily, etc.)
4. Configure notifications

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Time Filters**: Always include timestamp filters
2. **Limit Results**: Use LIMIT clause for large queries
3. **Optimize Joins**: Prefer pre-aggregation when possible
4. **Use Materialized Views**: For common query patterns
