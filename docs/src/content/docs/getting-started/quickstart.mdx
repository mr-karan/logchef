# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get Logchef up and running quickly. We'll cover installation, basic setup, and your first log query.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended) or ability to run Linux binaries
- A Clickhouse instance (included in Docker setup)
- Vector for log collection (optional)

## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Download the compose file
curl -LO https://github.com/mr-karan/logchef/raw/master/docker-compose.yml

# Start the services
docker compose up -d
```

### Using Binary

```bash
# Download the latest release
curl -LO https://github.com/mr-karan/logchef/releases/latest/download/logchef_linux_amd64

# Make it executable
chmod +x logchef_linux_amd64

# Run Logchef
./logchef_linux_amd64
```

## First Steps

1. Visit `http://localhost:8125` in your browser
2. Log in with the default credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
3. Change your password when prompted

## Configure Your First Data Source

1. Navigate to Settings > Data Sources
2. Click "Add Data Source"
3. Enter your Clickhouse connection details:
   ```yaml
   host: localhost
   port: 9000
   database: default
   table: logs
   ```
4. Test the connection and save

## Write Your First Query

1. Go to the Query Interface
2. Try a simple query:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     timestamp,
     level,
     message
   FROM logs
   WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC
   LIMIT 100
   ```
3. Click "Run Query" to see your results
