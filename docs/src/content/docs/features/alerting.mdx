LogChef provides a powerful alerting system that continuously evaluates your log data against custom conditions. When thresholds are exceeded, alerts are automatically sent to Alertmanager, which routes notifications to your preferred channels like Slack, PagerDuty, email, or webhooks.

The alerting system is designed for production use with built-in reliability features including retry logic, delivery failure tracking, and comprehensive error handling.

## How it Works

LogChef's alert manager runs in the background, continuously evaluating active alerts at the configured interval (default: 1 minute). When an alert's SQL query returns a value that exceeds the threshold, the alert fires and is sent to Alertmanager with full context including labels, annotations, and metadata.

### Alert Lifecycle

1. **Evaluation**: Alert SQL query runs against ClickHouse
2. **Threshold Check**: Result is compared against configured threshold
3. **Triggered**: If threshold is met, alert fires and is sent to Alertmanager
4. **Grouped**: Alertmanager groups similar alerts by team, source, and severity
5. **Routed**: Notifications are sent to configured receivers (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
6. **Resolved**: When conditions clear, a resolution notification is sent

## Creating Alerts

### Basic Alert Configuration

Every alert requires the following components:

- **Name**: Human-readable identifier for the alert
- **Description**: Optional context about what the alert monitors
- **Severity**: `info`, `warning`, or `critical`
- **Query**: ClickHouse SQL that returns a single numeric value
- **Threshold**: Value and operator (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)
- **Frequency**: How often to evaluate the alert (in seconds)
- **Lookback Window**: Time range for the query to analyze

### Example Alerts

#### High Error Rate

Monitor when error log count exceeds acceptable levels:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as value
FROM logs
WHERE severity_text = 'ERROR'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
```

**Threshold**: Greater than 100
**Frequency**: 60 seconds
**Severity**: Critical

---

#### API Response Time Degradation

Detect when API response times spike:

```sql
SELECT avg(JSONExtractFloat(log_attributes, 'response_time_ms')) as value
FROM logs
WHERE service = 'api-gateway'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE
```

**Threshold**: Greater than 500.0 (ms)
**Frequency**: 120 seconds
**Severity**: Warning

---

#### Failed Authentication Attempts

Alert on suspicious authentication activity:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as value
FROM logs
WHERE body LIKE '%authentication failed%'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 15 MINUTE
```

**Threshold**: Greater than 10
**Frequency**: 300 seconds
**Severity**: Warning

---

#### Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

Monitor when connection pool usage is critically high:

```sql
SELECT max(JSONExtractInt(log_attributes, 'pool_active_connections')) as value
FROM logs
WHERE service = 'database-proxy'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
```

**Threshold**: Greater than or equal to 95
**Frequency**: 60 seconds
**Severity**: Critical

---

#### Memory Usage Threshold

Alert when application memory usage exceeds limits:

```sql
SELECT avg(JSONExtractFloat(log_attributes, 'memory_mb')) as value
FROM logs
WHERE namespace = 'production'
  AND log_attributes LIKE '%memory_mb%'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
```

**Threshold**: Greater than 8000.0 (MB)
**Frequency**: 180 seconds
**Severity**: Warning

## Configuration

### Admin Settings UI

Alerting is configured through the **Administration → System Settings → Alerts** tab in the web interface. This provides a user-friendly way to manage all alert settings without editing configuration files.

**Available Settings:**
- **Enabled**: Toggle alert evaluation on/off
- **Alertmanager URL**: Endpoint for sending alerts
  - Test connectivity with the built-in health check button
  - Supports HTTP Basic Auth: `https://username:password@alertmanager.example.com`
- **Evaluation Interval**: How often to evaluate all alerts
- **Default Lookback**: Default time range for alert queries
- **History Limit**: Number of historical events to keep per alert
- **External URL**: Backend URL for API access
- **Frontend URL**: Frontend URL for web UI links in alert notifications
- **Request Timeout**: HTTP timeout for Alertmanager requests
- **TLS Insecure Skip Verify**: Skip TLS certificate verification (development only)

### Initial Configuration (First Boot)

On first boot, you can optionally seed alert settings from `config.toml`. After first boot, all changes must be made via the Admin Settings UI:

```toml
[alerts]
# Enable alert evaluation and delivery
enabled = true

# How often to evaluate all alerts (default: 1 minute)
evaluation_interval = "1m"

# Default lookback window if not specified in alert (default: 5 minutes)
default_lookback = "5m"

# Maximum alert history entries to keep per alert (default: 50)
history_limit = 50

# Alertmanager API endpoint
alertmanager_url = "http://alertmanager:9093"

# Backend URL for API access (used for fallback)
external_url = "http://localhost:8125"

# Frontend URL for web UI generator links
frontend_url = "http://localhost:5173"

# HTTP request timeout for Alertmanager communication
request_timeout = "5s"

# Skip TLS certificate verification (for development only)
tls_insecure_skip_verify = false
```

**Note:** After first boot, changes to `[alerts]` in `config.toml` are ignored. Use the Admin Settings UI to modify alert configuration.

### Alertmanager Authentication

If your Alertmanager requires authentication, include credentials in the URL using HTTP Basic Auth:

**Format:**
```
https://username:password@alertmanager.example.com
```

**Examples:**
```
# Basic authentication
https://admin:secretpass@alertmanager.internal:9093

# URL-encoded special characters in password
https://admin:my%40pass%3A123@alertmanager.internal:9093
```

**Special character encoding:**
- `@` → `%40`
- `:` → `%3A`
- `#` → `%23`
- `%` → `%25`
- Space → `%20`

### Testing Connectivity

Before saving Alertmanager configuration, use the **Test Connection** button in the Admin Settings UI to verify:
- Alertmanager is reachable
- Authentication credentials are correct
- Network connectivity is working
- TLS certificates are valid (or properly skipped)

The health check calls Alertmanager's `/api/v2/status` endpoint and reports success or detailed error messages.

### Alertmanager Configuration

Configure Alertmanager to route LogChef alerts to your notification channels. Example configuration:

```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
  receiver: 'default-receiver'
  group_by: ['alertname', 'severity', 'team', 'source']
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 30s
  repeat_interval: 12h

  routes:
    # Critical alerts to PagerDuty
    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: 'pagerduty'
      continue: true

    # Warning alerts to Slack
    - match:
        severity: warning
      receiver: 'slack-oncall'

receivers:
  - name: 'default-receiver'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'http://webhook-receiver:8080/alerts'

  - name: 'pagerduty'
    pagerduty_configs:
      - service_key: 'YOUR_SERVICE_KEY'

  - name: 'slack-oncall'
    slack_configs:
      - api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL'
        channel: '#alerts'
        title: 'LogChef Alert: {{ .GroupLabels.alertname }}'
```

## Alert Labels and Annotations

### Default Labels

Every alert includes these labels automatically:

- `alertname`: Name of the alert
- `alert_id`: Unique alert identifier
- `severity`: Alert severity level
- `status`: Current status (`triggered` or `resolved`)
- `team`: Human-readable team name
- `team_id`: Numeric team identifier
- `source`: Human-readable source name
- `source_id`: Numeric source identifier

### Custom Labels

Add custom labels to categorize and route alerts:

```json
{
  "env": "production",
  "service": "payment-api",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "component": "database"
}
```

These labels can be used in Alertmanager routing rules to send alerts to appropriate teams or channels.

### Annotations

Annotations provide additional context that doesn't affect routing:

- `description`: Alert description text
- `query`: The SQL query used for evaluation
- `threshold`: Threshold value and operator
- `value`: Actual value that triggered the alert
- `frequency_seconds`: Evaluation frequency
- `lookback_seconds`: Query lookback window

Custom annotations can be added for runbooks, dashboards, or documentation links:

```json
{
  "runbook": "https://wiki.example.com/runbooks/high-error-rate",
  "dashboard": "https://grafana.example.com/d/logs-overview",
  "playbook": "Check database connection pool and recent deployments"
}
```

## Alert History

LogChef maintains a complete history of all alert evaluations including:

- **Triggered Events**: When alerts fire with the metric value
- **Resolved Events**: When conditions clear
- **Error Events**: Query failures or evaluation errors
- **Delivery Status**: Whether alerts successfully reached Alertmanager

Access alert history through the web UI to investigate:
- Why an alert fired
- How long it stayed active
- Previous occurrences and patterns
- Delivery failures and retries

## Reliability Features

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

If Alertmanager is temporarily unavailable, LogChef automatically retries alert delivery:

- **Default**: 2 retry attempts
- **Initial Delay**: 500ms
- **Backoff**: Exponential (500ms → 1s → 2s)
- **Retry On**: Network errors and 5xx HTTP status codes

### Delivery Failure Tracking

Failed deliveries are recorded in alert history with:
- Error message and timestamp
- Retry attempts counter
- Automatic retry on next evaluation cycle

### Evaluation Error Handling

Query failures or database issues are captured as error status in history:
- Error message preserved for debugging
- Query and configuration included in error payload
- Alert evaluation continues on next cycle

## Monitoring Alerts

### Log Messages

Alert evaluations produce structured logs for observability:

```json
// Successful evaluation
{"level":"DEBUG","msg":"alert evaluation complete","alert_id":1,"value":42.5,"triggered":true}

// Alert triggered
{"level":"INFO","msg":"alert triggered","alert_name":"High Error Rate","value":150,"threshold":100}

// Successful delivery
{"level":"INFO","msg":"alert successfully sent to Alertmanager","alert_id":1}

// Alert resolved
{"level":"INFO","msg":"alert resolved","alert_name":"High Error Rate","value":45}
```

### Alertmanager UI

Access the Alertmanager web interface to:
- View active alerts and their current status
- See alert grouping and routing decisions
- Silence alerts temporarily
- Inspect alert payloads and labels

## Best Practices

### Query Design

- **Return Single Value**: Queries must return exactly one numeric value
- **Use Lookback Windows**: Always include a time filter for performance
- **Test First**: Use "Test Query" in the UI to validate before saving
- **Keep it Simple**: Complex aggregations may timeout or return unexpected results

### Threshold Selection

- **Avoid Flapping**: Set thresholds with enough buffer to prevent constant triggering
- **Consider Baselines**: Analyze normal metrics before setting thresholds
- **Use Percentiles**: For variable metrics, consider 95th or 99th percentile instead of max/avg

### Frequency Configuration

- **Match Urgency**: Critical alerts can evaluate every 30-60 seconds
- **Resource Aware**: Frequent evaluation increases database load
- **Align with Lookback**: Evaluation frequency should be less than lookback window

### Organization

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, searchable alert names
- **Team Ownership**: Assign alerts to appropriate teams
- **Runbook Links**: Add runbook URLs in annotations for quick response
- **Review Regularly**: Audit and tune alerts based on actual incidents

### Production Deployment

- **Use TLS**: Always enable TLS for Alertmanager communication in production
- **Set External URL**: Configure frontend_url for correct generator links
- **Configure Receivers**: Set up PagerDuty, Slack, or email for critical alerts
- **Test Notifications**: Verify alert delivery to all configured channels
- **Monitor Alertmanager**: Ensure Alertmanager itself is monitored and has high availability

## Troubleshooting

### Alerts Not Firing

1. **Check Alert Status**: Verify alert is enabled and active
2. **Test Query**: Run the SQL query manually to verify it returns a numeric value
3. **Check Logs**: Look for evaluation errors in LogChef logs
4. **Verify Frequency**: Ensure enough time has passed since last evaluation

### Alerts Not Delivered

1. **Check Alertmanager URL**: Verify alertmanager_url in config is correct
2. **Test Connectivity**: Ensure LogChef can reach Alertmanager (`curl http://alertmanager:9093/-/healthy`)
3. **Review Logs**: Check for delivery errors in LogChef logs
4. **Inspect History**: Check alert history for delivery failure details

### False Positives

1. **Adjust Threshold**: Increase threshold to reduce noise
2. **Extend Lookback**: Longer windows smooth out temporary spikes
3. **Use Aggregation**: Consider avg() instead of max() for less sensitive alerts
4. **Add Filters**: Narrow down query to specific services or conditions

### Performance Issues

1. **Optimize Queries**: Add appropriate indexes in ClickHouse
2. **Reduce Frequency**: Increase evaluation interval for non-critical alerts
3. **Limit Lookback**: Shorter time windows query less data
4. **Monitor Database**: Watch ClickHouse query performance

## Example Workflows

### Setting Up Your First Alert

1. Navigate to Alerts in your team/source
2. Click "Create Alert"
3. Name: "High Error Count"
4. Query: `SELECT count(*) as value FROM logs WHERE severity_text = 'ERROR' AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE`
5. Threshold: Greater than 50
6. Frequency: 60 seconds
7. Severity: Warning
8. Click "Test Query" to verify
9. Save and monitor alert history

### Creating an On-Call Rotation

1. Set up PagerDuty integration in Alertmanager
2. Create critical alerts for your services
3. Tag alerts with `severity: critical` and `team: your-team`
4. Configure Alertmanager route to match on team label
5. Test with a temporary threshold adjustment

### Building a Comprehensive Monitoring Suite

1. **Error Alerts**: Monitor error rates across all services
2. **Performance Alerts**: Track response times and latency
3. **Availability Alerts**: Watch for service health check failures
4. **Resource Alerts**: Monitor memory, CPU, and connection pools
5. **Business Metrics**: Alert on transaction failures or conversion drops
