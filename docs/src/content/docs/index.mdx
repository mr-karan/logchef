## Built for Developers

### Query Your Way

Write queries the way you think:

- **Simple syntax**: `level="error" and service="api"` — no query language to learn
- **Full SQL**: Drop into raw ClickHouse SQL when you need aggregations or joins
- **AI assistant**: Describe what you're looking for in plain English
- **[MCP integration](/integration/mcp-server)**: Let Claude or other AI assistants query your logs directly

### Field Sidebar

Discover and filter your data visually:

- See top values for each field at a glance
- Click any value to filter — no typing required
- Alt-click to exclude values
- Auto-loads low-cardinality fields, click-to-load for high-cardinality
- [Learn more](/features/field-sidebar)

### Keyboard-First UX

- **Esc** to cancel long-running queries (stops them in ClickHouse too)
- **Double-click** column dividers to auto-fit width
- **Click** any cell to copy its value
- Expand rows inline to see full log context

## Team Ready

- **Multi-tenant**: Organize users into teams with separate log sources
- **Access control**: Define who can query what
- **Collections**: Save and share queries with your team

## Real-Time Alerting

Monitor your logs continuously:

- Define alerts using SQL queries you already know
- Route to Slack, PagerDuty, email via Alertmanager
- Full history of evaluations and triggers
- [Set up alerting](/features/alerting)

## Why ClickHouse?

ClickHouse is built for exactly this workload:

- **Fast**: Columnar storage + vectorized execution = sub-second queries on billions of rows
- **Cheap**: 10-20x better compression than Elasticsearch
- **Flexible**: Full SQL with analytical functions
- **Battle-tested**: Powers analytics at Uber, Cloudflare, eBay

Logchef gives you a purpose-built UI to unlock this power for log analytics.

## Open Source

Logchef is open source under AGPLv3. No telemetry, no phone-home, no vendor lock-in.
