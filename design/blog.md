# Technical Deep Dive: Taming JSON in ClickHouse - A Tale of Protocol Quirks and Performance

## Introduction

When building LogChef, a high-performance log analytics platform, we needed to efficiently handle JSON data from ClickHouse. What seemed like a straightforward task turned into an interesting journey through ClickHouse's protocols, drivers, and performance optimizations. This post shares our learnings and solutions.

## The Challenge

The seemingly simple task: "Get log data as JSON from ClickHouse." However, this opened up several interesting challenges:

1. The ClickHouse native protocol doesn't support `FORMAT JSON` directly
2. Column type information is lost when using string-based JSON conversion
3. Performance implications of JSON serialization at scale

## Understanding ClickHouse Protocols

ClickHouse offers two main protocols:

1. **Native Protocol** (port 9000)

   - Binary format, highly efficient
   - Limited to native data types
   - No direct JSON support
   - Used by official Go driver

2. **HTTP Protocol** (port 8123)
   - Supports multiple formats including JSON
   - Rich metadata in responses
   - Higher overhead
   - Better tooling integration

```sql
-- Over HTTP, this works:
SELECT * FROM logs FORMAT JSON

-- Over native protocol, this fails:
SELECT * FROM logs FORMAT JSON  -- Driver error!
```

## The Evolution of Our Solution

### Attempt 1: Using OpenDB

The first approach was using `database/sql` with ClickHouse's OpenDB:

```go
conn := clickhouse.OpenDB(&clickhouse.Options{
    Addr: []string{"127.0.0.1:9000"},
    Protocol: clickhouse.Native,
})

rows, err := conn.QueryContext(ctx, "SELECT * FROM logs LIMIT 10")
columns, _ := rows.Columns()
colTypes, _ := rows.ColumnTypes()

// Manually construct JSON from rows
for rows.Next() {
    // Complex type mapping and JSON construction
}
```

**Problems:**

- Performance overhead of reflection
- Complex type mapping
- Memory inefficient for large datasets

### Attempt 2: Native Protocol with JSON String

We then tried leveraging ClickHouse's JSON functions:

```sql
SELECT toString(tuple(*)) FROM logs
```

**Problems:**

- Lost column type information
- No metadata about the structure
- Escaping issues with nested JSON

### The Final Solution: Smart JSON Wrapping

We developed a technique that combines the best of both worlds:

```sql
WITH query AS (
    SELECT * FROM logs WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
)
SELECT
    JSONExtractKeysAndValuesRaw(toJSONString(*)) as _column_info,
    toJSONString(tuple(*)) as raw_json
FROM query
```

This approach:

1. Preserves column types through metadata
2. Maintains native protocol performance
3. Handles nested structures correctly
4. Single round-trip to the database

The Go implementation:

```go
type QueryResult struct {
    Columns []struct {
        Name string
        Type string
    }
    Data []map[string]interface{}
}

func (c *Client) Query(ctx context.Context, query string) (*QueryResult, error) {
    wrappedQuery := fmt.Sprintf(`
        WITH query AS (%s)
        SELECT
            JSONExtractKeysAndValuesRaw(toJSONString(*)) as _column_info,
            toJSONString(tuple(*)) as raw_json
        FROM query
    `, query)

    // Execute and parse...
}
```

### A Simpler Solution for Schemaless Analytics

While our previous solution is comprehensive, for schemaless log analytics we discovered a more elegant approach:

```sql
WITH query AS (
    SELECT
        service_name,
        count(*) AS count
    FROM logs.vector_logs
    GROUP BY service_name
)
SELECT
    JSONExtractKeys(toJSONString(tuple(*))) AS _col_names,
    toJSONString(tuple(*)) AS raw_json
FROM query
LIMIT 1
```

This produces clean, ready-to-use output:

```json
{
  "_col_names": ["service_name", "count"],
  "raw_json": { "service_name": "Scarface", "count": "90" }
}
```

**Why this works better for logs:**

1. **Simplicity**:

   - No need for complex type mapping
   - Column names are sufficient for display
   - JSON is properly formatted by ClickHouse

2. **Performance**:

   - Fewer JSON operations
   - Smaller network payload
   - No type conversion overhead

3. **Schemaless Nature**:
   - Perfect for dynamic log fields
   - No need to maintain type information
   - Easier to handle schema changes

The Go implementation becomes much simpler:

```go
type SchemalessResult struct {
    ColumnNames []string          `json:"_col_names"`
    Data       json.RawMessage    `json:"raw_json"`
}

func (c *Client) QueryLogs(ctx context.Context, query string) (*SchemalessResult, error) {
    wrappedQuery := fmt.Sprintf(`
        WITH query AS (%s)
        SELECT
            JSONExtractKeys(toJSONString(tuple(*))) AS _col_names,
            toJSONString(tuple(*)) AS raw_json
        FROM query
        LIMIT 1
    `, query)

    // Execute and parse...
    // The response is already in the correct format!
}
```

### An Even Better Solution: DESCRIBE TABLE with CTEs

While exploring ClickHouse's capabilities, we discovered an elegant solution using `DESCRIBE TABLE` with Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

```sql
-- First query: Get schema
DESCRIBE TABLE (
    WITH query AS (
        SELECT
            service_name,
            count(*) AS count
        FROM logs.vector_logs
        GROUP BY service_name
    )
    SELECT * FROM query
)

-- Second query: Get data
WITH query AS (
    SELECT
        service_name,
        count(*) AS count
    FROM logs.vector_logs
    GROUP BY service_name
)
SELECT
    toJSONString(tuple(*)) AS raw_json
FROM query
```

This produces exact type information:

```
┌─name─────────┬─type───────────────────┐
│ service_name │ LowCardinality(String) │
│ count        │ UInt64                 │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this is better:**

1. **Exact Types**:

   - Gets real ClickHouse types including special types like `LowCardinality`
   - No type inference needed
   - Handles complex types correctly

2. **Query Flexibility**:

   - Works with any SELECT query including aggregations
   - Preserves the actual types of computed columns
   - No JSON parsing overhead for type detection

3. **Native Protocol Compatible**:
   - Works perfectly with the native protocol
   - No need for JSON functions
   - Better performance

The Go implementation becomes:

```go
type ColumnInfo struct {
    Name string
    Type string
}

func (c *Client) QueryWithTypes(ctx context.Context, query string) (*QueryResult, error) {
    // First get column types
    schemaQuery := fmt.Sprintf("DESCRIBE TABLE (\n%s\n)", query)
    schemaRows, err := c.db.Query(ctx, schemaQuery)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("schema query failed: %w", err)
    }
    defer schemaRows.Close()

    var columns []ColumnInfo
    for schemaRows.Next() {
        var col ColumnInfo
        var defaultType, defaultExpr, comment, codec, ttl string
        if err := schemaRows.Scan(&col.Name, &col.Type, &defaultType, &defaultExpr, &comment, &codec, &ttl); err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("schema scan failed: %w", err)
        }
        columns = append(columns, col)
    }

    // Then get data
    dataQuery := fmt.Sprintf(`
        WITH query AS (%s)
        SELECT toJSONString(tuple(*)) AS raw_json
        FROM query
    `, query)

    dataRows, err := c.db.Query(ctx, dataQuery)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("data query failed: %w", err)
    }
    defer dataRows.Close()

    // Process results...
    return &QueryResult{
        Columns: columns,
        Data:    data,
    }, nil
}
```

## Performance Implications

Our solution has some interesting performance characteristics:

1. **JSON Serialization**

   - Done once on the ClickHouse side
   - Avoids multiple conversions in Go
   - Leverages ClickHouse's optimized JSON functions

2. **Memory Usage**

   - Direct string handling instead of intermediate structs
   - No reflection overhead
   - Efficient for large datasets

3. **Network Transfer**
   - Single round-trip
   - Compressed JSON transfer
   - Minimal protocol overhead

## Benchmarks

Some real-world numbers from our production environment:

```
Query: 1M rows with 20 columns

Native Protocol (raw):        2.1s
HTTP Protocol (JSON):         3.4s
Our Solution:                 2.3s
```

The minimal overhead (0.2s) comes with significant benefits in usability and maintainability.

## Comprehensive Benchmarks

We ran extensive benchmarks comparing the HTTP and Native protocols across different CPU configurations. Each test retrieved 10,000 log records with full schema information, running on an Intel i7-1370P processor.

### Test Configuration

```bash
go test -bench=. \
  -benchmem \
  -benchtime=5x \
  -count=5 \
  -cpu=1,2,4,8
```

### Results Analysis

1. **Single CPU Performance**

   ```
   HTTP:  ~217ms latency, 31.5 MB/op, 356K allocs/op
   Native: ~351ms latency, 60.0 MB/op, 658K allocs/op
   ```

   The HTTP interface shows significantly better memory efficiency and lower latency.

2. **Multi-CPU Scaling**

   ```
   Cores | HTTP Latency | Native Latency
   ------|--------------|---------------
   1     | 217ms       | 351ms
   2     | 214ms       | 391ms
   4     | 255ms       | 271ms
   8     | 48ms        | 432ms
   ```

   HTTP protocol shows excellent scaling, especially with 8 cores.

3. **Memory and Allocations**

   - HTTP consistently uses ~31.5 MB/op with ~356K allocations
   - Native uses ~60 MB/op with ~658K allocations
   - HTTP achieves 47% memory savings and 46% fewer allocations

4. **Data Transfer Efficiency**

   - HTTP transfers 3.43 MB/op with gzip compression
   - Built-in compression in HTTP reduces network load
   - Native protocol doesn't report bytes (internal protocol)

5. **Reliability Metrics**
   - Zero errors across all test runs for both protocols
   - HTTP shows more consistent latency patterns
   - Native protocol shows higher variance in response times

### Key Findings

1. **HTTP Protocol Advantages**

   - 47% less memory usage
   - 46% fewer allocations
   - Better multi-core scaling
   - More consistent performance
   - Built-in compression

2. **CPU Utilization**

   - HTTP performs best with 8 CPUs (~48ms/op)
   - Native protocol optimal at 4 CPUs
   - HTTP shows better scaling characteristics

3. **Performance Characteristics**
   ```
   Protocol | Best Latency | Memory Usage | Allocations
   ---------|--------------|--------------|------------
   HTTP     | 48ms        | 31.5 MB     | 356K
   Native   | 91ms        | 60.0 MB     | 658K
   ```

These benchmarks validate our decision to migrate to the HTTP interface, showing significant improvements in:

- Memory efficiency
- CPU scalability
- Allocation patterns
- Response time consistency

The results also highlight the importance of proper connection pooling and compression settings, which we've implemented in our production environment.

## Future Improvements

The upcoming ClickHouse driver v3 promises native support for multiple formats:

```go
// Future API (proposed)
rows, err := conn.QueryFormat(ctx, query, clickhouse.FormatJSON)
```

Until then, our solution provides a robust and efficient way to handle JSON data in ClickHouse.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Protocol Understanding is Crucial**

   - Different protocols have different capabilities
   - Choose based on your specific needs

2. **Performance vs. Convenience**

   - Native protocol is fastest but limited
   - HTTP protocol is flexible but slower
   - Smart wrapping can give you both

3. **Think in ClickHouse**
   - Leverage ClickHouse's functions
   - Let the database do the heavy lifting
   - Minimize data transformations

## Conclusion

Working with JSON in ClickHouse requires understanding its protocols and their limitations. Our solution demonstrates that with careful design, you can achieve both performance and convenience. The key is to leverage ClickHouse's strengths while working around its limitations.

The code for this implementation is available in our open-source project [LogChef](https://github.com/logchef/logchef).
