### Integration

```javascript
// Example integration code
import { LogQLEditor } from '@company/logql-editor'

<LogQLEditor
  v-model="query"
  :theme="editorTheme"
  :suggestions="customSuggestions"
  @queryChange="handleQueryChange"
  @error="handleError"
/>
```

## Component API

### Props

- `value` (String): Current query value
- `theme` (String): Editor theme ('dark'|'light')
- `suggestions` (Array): Custom autocomplete suggestions
- `readOnly` (Boolean): Editor read-only state
- `height` (String): Editor height
- `width` (String): Editor width

### Events

- `@change`: Emitted on query changes
- `@error`: Emitted on syntax errors
- `@save`: Emitted when Ctrl+S/Cmd+S is pressed
- `@execute`: Emitted when Ctrl+Enter is pressed

## Success Metrics

1. Editor Performance

   - Time to first interaction < 1s
   - Smooth scrolling experience (60 fps)
   - Memory usage within specified limits

2. User Experience

   - < 5% error rate in query syntax
   - > 80% autocomplete suggestion accuracy
   - < 2s average time to find and use required LogQL functions

3. Integration Success
   - < 30 minutes average integration time
   - Zero conflicts with existing Vue components
   - < 5% increase in application bundle size
