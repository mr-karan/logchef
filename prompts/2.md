Below are some ideas and best practices you can consider to design a more powerful and flexible filter language for your log analytics system. Some of these suggestions might require additional handling or changes in your application or schema, but they should give you an idea of what “next-level” filter functionality can look like.

---

## 1. Support for AND/OR/NOT Logic (Nested/Compound Filters)

Right now, the code appears to apply all filters using an implicit AND. If you need more complex filtering logic, you can allow **grouped filters** with nested AND/OR/NOT logic:

```go
// Example: (fieldA = 'valueA' AND fieldB > 10) OR NOT(fieldC CONTAINS 'xyz')
Filters: []models.FilterCondition{
    {
        Operator: "OR",
        Conditions: []models.FilterCondition{
            {
                Operator: "AND",
                Conditions: []models.FilterCondition{
                    { Field: "fieldA", Operator: "=", Value: "valueA" },
                    { Field: "fieldB", Operator: ">", Value: 10 },
                },
            },
            {
                Operator: "NOT",
                Condition: {
                    Field: "fieldC", Operator: "CONTAINS", Value: "xyz"
                },
            },
        },
    },
}
```

- **Implementation**:
  - Replace the simple `[]FilterCondition` with a tree-like structure that can nest multiple conditions under an AND/OR/NOT node.
  - Evaluate this tree recursively to generate the right SQL.
  - For example, you could have a `ConditionGroup` that has an `operator` (AND/OR/NOT) and children either being `FilterCondition`s (leaves) or other `ConditionGroup`s.

This significantly increases expressiveness, as users can build complex logical expressions with brackets, nested conditions, etc.

---

## 2. Null Checks (IS NULL / IS NOT NULL)

Often for logs, you want to find fields that **either exist or don’t exist**. Adding explicit checks for null values can be valuable:

```go
// Example usage
// If a user wants logs where user_id is missing:
{ Field: "user_id", Operator: "IS_NULL" }

// If a user wants logs where user_id is not null:
{ Field: "user_id", Operator: "IS_NOT_NULL" }
```

- **Implementation**:
  - In ClickHouse, you can do `sb.Where(sb.IsNull("field"))` or `sb.Where(sb.NotIsNull("field"))`.
  - Make sure to handle the data type properly (some fields might never be `NULL` if they are typed non-null).

---

## 3. Regex / Pattern Matching

ClickHouse offers `match()` or you can use the `LIKE` operator extensively. For advanced text searching, you could add:

- **Regex**: `field ~ 'some.*regex'`
- **Case-insensitive**: You can do `ILIKE` in some SQL dialects or rely on `LOWER(field) LIKE LOWER('%value%')` if you want to approximate case insensitivity.

**In a filter structure**:

```go
{ Field: "message", Operator: "REGEX", Value: "error.*timeout" }
```

Implementation detail:

```sql
-- In ClickHouse, you can do:
-- "fieldName" REGEXP 'some.*pattern'
```

---

## 4. Range Filters (Between)

When you want an inclusive or exclusive range:

```go
{ Field: "latency", Operator: "BETWEEN", Value: [10, 50] }
```

- Instead of separate `>=` and `<=` conditions, `BETWEEN` is syntactic sugar that clarifies intent.
- You could parse that filter to produce something like `latency BETWEEN 10 AND 50`.

---

## 5. Support for Functions / Transformations

Logs often include data that needs to be normalized or transformed for better searching (e.g., extracting just the domain from a URL, or checking a substring of a message). You could allow users to reference built-in or custom transformations, for example:

```go
{ Function: "lower", Field: "username", Operator: "=", Value: "alice" }
```

- This translates to `LOWER(username) = 'alice'`.

**Implementation**:

- You can enhance your filter structure to include an optional “function” or “transformation” that wraps the field reference in your SQL.
- Common transformations: `LOWER()`, `TO_STRING()`, `TO_INT()`, `substring()`, `toDateTime()`, etc.

---

## 6. Fuzzy / Proximity Searches

For logs that have free-text message fields, you may want to do approximate matching.

- **Fuzzy match**: e.g., “message contains something spelled similarly to the user’s input.”
- This might integrate with a full-text search engine approach (e.g., ClickHouse’s `text` index or specialized engines like Elastic, but you can approximate with triple LIKE operators or specialized dictionary-based methods).

---

## 7. Enhanced Time Filters (Relative Times, Ranges, Macros)

Sometimes you want queries like:

- “Last 24 hours”
- “Yesterday’s logs only”
- “Last 5 minutes from now”

Instead of requiring exact timestamps, you can provide macros or relative time syntax:

```go
// "start_time": "now() - 24h"
// "end_time": "now()"
```

- Or you can parse strings like `“last_24h”`, `“yesterday”`, or `“past_30m”` in your backend, converting them to the relevant date/time range.

---

## 8. Field Existence Checks

Similar to null checks but more explicit:

```go
{ Field: "exceptionStackTrace", Operator: "EXISTS" }
```

- Means “this field must be present in the log.”
- This can be important in JSON-based logs, especially if not all fields exist in every row.

---

## 9. Type Casting Operators

If your logs have dynamic fields (e.g., a JSON column with varying data types), you might want to let users cast a field on the fly:

```go
{ Field: "attributes->>'response_time'", TypeCast: "Float64", Operator: ">", Value: 1.5 }
```

- This way, you parse “response_time” as float and compare.
- In ClickHouse, you can do something like `CAST(JSON_EXTRACT_FIELD, 'Float64') > 1.5`.

---

## 10. Pre-Filter & Post-Filter (Client-Side / App-Side)

Sometimes you only want the database to do coarse filtering, then do a final pass in application code to handle complex or less-performant operators. This is relevant if certain types of filters are tricky to do in SQL or would degrade performance:

- Example: advanced string metrics or partial matching logic could be done in Go after retrieving a subset of data.
- Or you can refine results if you suspect the filter might be very selective but is complicated to express in SQL.

---

## 11. Query DSL Approach

If you want a one-stop approach for all advanced filtering, consider letting users specify a DSL (domain-specific language) in a JSON or text-based format—something like a simpler version of the Lucene or Kibana Query DSL. For instance:

```json
{
  "bool": {
    "must": [
      { "term": { "fieldA": "valueA" } },
      { "range": { "fieldB": { "gt": 10 } } }
    ],
    "must_not": [{ "wildcard": { "fieldC": "xyz*" } }]
  }
}
```

- Then parse this DSL into your ClickHouse SQL.
- This can be as simple or complex as your application needs and can grow over time.

---

## 12. Handling Large `IN` / `NOT IN` Lists with External Tables

If your users do large `IN` or `NOT IN` lists (like thousands or millions of IDs), you might consider:

- **External tables**: You can upload a temporary table to ClickHouse and then join rather than doing a large `IN` list. This avoids huge query strings and is more performant.

---

## 13. Custom “Macros” or “Aliases”

You can define “macros” so your filter language can be more user-friendly:

- For example, `@serviceErrors` might expand to `(http_status >= 400 OR has_error = 1)`.
- Could be helpful if you have certain repeated or domain-specific logic that users reference often.

---

## 14. Intelligent Validation & Hints

Users often make mistakes like searching a numeric field with a string, or searching a text field with an integer operator. You can:

- Validate the field type and operator compatibility.
- Provide suggestions or alternatives if the user attempts an invalid filter. For example, “`Field ‘status_code’ is numeric, you used CONTAINS. Did you mean EQUALS or BETWEEN?`”

---

## 15. Observability-Focused Operators

Because you’re dealing with OTEL logs (and possibly spans, traces, metrics), you could provide specialized filters for:

- **Trace ID**: Quick retrieval of logs belonging to a single trace.
- **Span ID**: Similar.
- **Resource attributes**: A structured approach to filtering on resource attributes like `service.name`, `service.version`, or `host.name`.

This can tie in with your hierarchical or nested filter approach so that users can do something like “Get me all logs from `service.name='checkout-service'` with `trace_id='abc123'` that happened in the last hour and have `log.level='ERROR'`.”

---

### Putting It All Together

A truly excellent filter system might:

1. Allow nested AND/OR/NOT groups.
2. Include advanced text operators (REGEX, wildcard, fuzzy).
3. Provide specific date/time macros and relative times.
4. Handle null checks and field existence.
5. Allow transformations and type casts for complex fields.
6. Optionally provide a user-friendly or domain-specific DSL for concise, powerful queries.
7. Validate queries and suggest corrections or improvements.

This approach gives end-users extremely flexible ways to slice-and-dice logs. Internally, you decide which features are crucial right now (e.g., nested logic, null checks, basic transformations) and which can be introduced incrementally (regex, DSL, advanced macros, etc.).

---

## Final Thoughts

Designing a filter language is about balancing **expressiveness**, **performance**, and **usability**. Start with the fundamentals—null checks, nesting, extra operators—and grow from there. Make sure to handle edge cases, especially around data types and potentially large queries. With these improvements, your log analytics solution will be far more robust and user-friendly.
