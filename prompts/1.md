We have the concept of "Managed" and "Unmanaged" sources.

In Managed Sources

- We just offer OTEL schema type
- TTL can be specified at the time of schema creation
- We create a attributes table behind the scenes - Materialized View for `Log_Attributes` table
- When we do a `/describe` on the source, we return the schema of the table as well as the unique columns in the table

In Unmanaged sources

- The schmea is defined by the user
- We just do a SELECT 1 so that we can check if the source is alive
- Discoverability will be limited to root columns only

In SQLite - our schema_type should be enum - managed or unmanaged

For managed sources, we should create a Materialized View for `_attributes` table. If table name is `abc` we should create a table `abc_attributes` which is Materialized View for `abc` table which stores the unique attribute keys. This will be useful when we do `/describe` on the source and when we need to filter/select the columns in UI.

```
Using maps
Earlier examples show the use of map syntax map['key'] to access values in the Map(String, String) columns. As well as using map notation to access the nested keys, specialized ClickHouse map functions are available for filtering or selecting these columns.

For example, the following query identifies all of the unique keys available in the LogAttributes column using the mapKeys function followed by the groupArrayDistinctArray function (a combinator).

SELECT groupArrayDistinctArray(mapKeys(LogAttributes))
FROM otel_logs
FORMAT Vertical

Row 1:
──────
groupArrayDistinctArray(mapKeys(LogAttributes)): ['remote_user','run_time','request_type','log.file.name','referer','request_path','status','user_agent','remote_addr','time_local','size','request_protocol']
