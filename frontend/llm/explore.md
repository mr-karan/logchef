Below is a detailed, task-oriented plan for implementing the Query/Explore page using shadcn components (and Tailwind for styling) while keeping the functionality focused on server-side filtering and querying. This plan breaks down the work into two main areas: the **Query Input & Interaction** and the **High-Performance Log Table**. Each section is broken into specific tasks to be completed over Weeks 5–6.

---

## **I. Query Input & Interaction**

### **Task 1: Design & Set Up the Query Input Area**

- **Select a Component for Query Input:**
  - **Option A:** Use a simple `<textarea>` styled with shadcn UI/Tailwind classes.
  - **Option B (Optional):** Integrate a lightweight code editor (e.g., [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/) or [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)) if syntax highlighting is required.
- **UI Implementation:**
  - Create a dedicated Query Input component.
  - Style the input area with appropriate padding, border, and focus states using Tailwind classes.
  - Ensure the area supports multi-line inputs and adjusts to various screen sizes.

### **Task 2: Implement Recent Query History**

- **Data Storage:**
  - Use a client-side store (such as Vue’s reactive state or local storage) to maintain a list of recent queries.
- **UI Integration:**
  - Create a dropdown or an auto-complete suggestion list below the query input.
  - Each recent query item should be clickable; when selected, it repopulates the query input field.
  - Style the suggestion list using shadcn UI components to match the overall design.

### **Task 3: Add Query Validation**

- **Basic Validation:**
  - Ensure the query input is not empty before submission.
  - Optionally, implement simple regex checks for syntactic correctness.
- **Feedback:**
  - Display inline error messages (using shadcn alert or text components) if validation fails.
  - Highlight the input field with error styling (e.g., red border) to indicate issues.

### **Task 4: Handle Query Submission**

- **Submission Workflow:**
  - Add a “Run Query” button styled with shadcn UI.
  - On click or on a keyboard shortcut (e.g., Enter or Ctrl+Enter), validate the query and then send an API request.
- **Loading & Response:**
  - Display a loading spinner or overlay on the query input area while awaiting a response.
  - On success, clear any error messages and update the Log Table with new results.
  - On failure, show a clear error notification using shadcn Toast or Alert components.
- **Update History:**
  - Once a query successfully executes, add it to the recent query history store.

### **Task 5: Enhance Query Interactions**

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Implement shortcuts (e.g., Enter/Return to submit, Esc to clear or close history suggestions).
- **Clear Button:**
  - Add a “Clear Query” button to quickly empty the input field.
- **Responsive Behavior:**
  - Ensure that the query input area is fully responsive and accessible on mobile devices.

## **II. High-Performance Log Table**

### **Task 1: Establish the Basic Table Structure**

- **Component Selection:**
  - Use a simple table component built with shadcn’s primitives and Tailwind styling.
- **Table Layout:**
  - Define key columns (e.g., Timestamp, Log Level, Message, Source, etc.).
  - Create a table header with column titles.
  - Build a table body that will be dynamically populated with log data from the server.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure the table is responsive and scrolls horizontally if needed.

### **Task 2: Implement Server-Side Pagination**

- **API Integration:**
  - Design the API call to include pagination parameters (page number, page size).
  - On each query submission or pagination control action, fetch the corresponding page of log entries.
- **UI Controls:**
  - Create pagination controls (e.g., “Previous,” “Next,” and page numbers) using shadcn buttons.
  - Display the current page and total pages.
- **Feedback:**
  - Show a loading state overlay on the table during data fetching.

### **Task 3: Add Column Resizing Functionality**

- **Resizing Mechanism:**
  - Implement a Vue directive or a small custom component to handle column resizing.
  - Attach draggable handles on the borders of the table header cells.
  - Provide visual feedback (a resizable line or ghost column) while the user drags.
- **Persisting State:**
  - Optionally store the new column widths in the component’s state so that they persist during the user’s session.

### **Task 4: Enable Column Visibility Toggling**

- **UI for Toggling:**
  - Create a “Column Settings” dropdown or modal using shadcn’s dropdown/modal components.
  - List all table columns with checkboxes for visibility.
- **Dynamic Table Update:**
  - When a user toggles a column, update the table view in real time.
- **Persist Settings:**
  - Store the user’s column visibility preferences in local storage or in a Vue store to maintain state across sessions.

### **Task 5: Optimize Table Rendering**

- **Rendering Performance:**
  - Since the filtering and sorting are server-side, ensure that the table renders rows efficiently.
  - If performance issues arise with many rows, consider implementing simple virtualization techniques (rendering only visible rows).
- **Smooth UI Updates:**
  - Use Vue’s reactivity system with appropriate keys on table rows to minimize re-renders.
  - Test and optimize scroll performance, especially when large datasets are returned.

## **III. Integration & Final Testing**

### **Task 1: Connect Query Input with the Log Table**

- **Data Flow:**
  - Ensure that submitting a query updates the Log Table with the corresponding data.
  - Handle edge cases such as empty responses or API errors.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Verify that loading states, success notifications, and error messages appear as expected.

### **Task 2: Responsive & Accessibility Checks**

- **Responsiveness:**
  - Test the Query page on multiple screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure all interactive elements have proper ARIA labels.
  - Validate keyboard navigation across both the query input and the table.

### **Task 3: Code Review & Testing**

- **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Write tests for the Query Input component (validation, submission, history handling).
  - Write tests for the Log Table (pagination, column resizing, column toggling).
- **User Acceptance Testing:**
  - Conduct a round of user testing with developers to gather feedback on usability and performance.
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Test with large datasets to ensure the table renders smoothly and interactions (resizing, toggling) remain snappy.

## **Timeline Recap (Weeks 5–6)**

- **Week 5:**

  - Complete the Query Input area (Tasks I.1–I.5).
  - Start building the basic Log Table structure with server-side pagination (Task II.1–II.2).

- **Week 6:**
  - Implement advanced Log Table features: column resizing (Task II.3) and column visibility toggling (Task II.4).
  - Optimize table rendering and ensure overall performance (Task II.5).
  - Integrate the Query Input and Log Table, then perform thorough testing and final refinements (Tasks III.1–III.3).

By following this detailed plan, you’ll be able to implement a robust Query/Explore page that provides developers with an intuitive interface for running queries and viewing large sets of log data—complete with recent query history, responsive server-side pagination, and dynamic table customization options using shadcn’s UI components.
