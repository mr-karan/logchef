# LogChefQL Enhanced Autocomplete Integration Status

## âœ… Integration Complete

The enhanced autocomplete system has been integrated into the Monaco setup. The system will activate automatically when Monaco initializes.

## What Changed

### Before Integration
- Only basic `and` and `or` suggestions
- No context awareness
- No field suggestions
- No operator suggestions
- No hover information

### After Integration (What You Should Now See)

#### 1. **Empty Query**
```
Cursor: |
Suggestions: timestamp, level, message, service, host, user_id, request_id, log_attributes, ()
```

#### 2. **After Field Name**
```
Query: level |
Suggestions: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ~, !~
Each with proper documentation on hover
```

#### 3. **After Operator**
```
Query: level = |
Suggestions: "info", "error", "debug", "warn", "trace", "fatal", true, false, null, "${1:value}"
```

#### 4. **After Value**
```
Query: level = "error" |
Suggestions: and, or, |
```

#### 5. **Complex Queries**
```
Query: level = "error" and service = "api" |
Suggestions: and, or, | (pipe for SELECT clause)
```

#### 6. **After Pipe**
```
Query: level = "error" | |
Suggestions: timestamp, message, service, user_id, request_id, log_attributes
```

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Activation**: The enhanced autocomplete registers when `initMonacoSetup()` is called
2. **Monaco Integration**: Uses Monaco's native completion and hover providers
3. **Context Detection**: Analyzes cursor position and tokens to determine appropriate suggestions
4. **Field Discovery**: Can be updated with custom fields from log samples

## Testing the Integration

### Quick Test
1. Open any LogChefQL editor in the application
2. Start typing in an empty editor
3. You should immediately see field suggestions (timestamp, level, message, etc.)
4. Type `level ` - you should see operator suggestions
5. Type `level = ` - you should see value suggestions with examples

### If You Still See Old Behavior
The integration might not be active yet. Check:
1. Browser console for any errors during Monaco initialization
2. Make sure you're using a LogChefQL editor (language: 'logchefql')
3. Try refreshing the page to trigger Monaco re-initialization

## Customizing Fields

To add custom fields discovered from your logs:

```typescript
import { updateLogChefQLAutocompleteFields } from '@/utils/monaco';

// Add fields discovered from logs
const customFields = [
  {
    name: 'trace_id',
    type: 'string',
    description: 'Distributed trace identifier',
    examples: ['abc123', 'xyz789']
  },
  {
    name: 'response_time_ms',
    type: 'number',
    description: 'Response time in milliseconds',
    examples: ['150', '2500']
  }
];

updateLogChefQLAutocompleteFields(customFields);
```

## Console Messages

When working correctly, you should see this in the browser console:
```
Enhanced LogChefQL language support registered with advanced autocomplete
```

## What's Next

The autocomplete system is now ready to use. You can:
1. Test it in any LogChefQL editor
2. Add field discovery from log samples
3. Customize field types for your specific log structure
4. Integrate with query history to suggest frequently used field combinations

The system should provide a significantly improved query writing experience with intelligent, context-aware suggestions at every step.
